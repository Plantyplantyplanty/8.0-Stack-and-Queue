    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None, I hope
        -Implemented: Doubly linked list functions, stack and queue with fowards and backwards
                      iterators.
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free hopefully.

    Reflections:
        I hope that it's up to standard and that I didn't somehow unlearn c++ over the summer.
